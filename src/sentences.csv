OpenNLP is a poorly-documented pain in the ass to figure out.
"There are various scattered resources you can find on the internet, none of which are particularly thorough, accurate, or up to date."
"The most useful that I’ve found is a blog post called Getting started with OpenNLP (Natural Language Processing), but it is over 4 years old and refers to version 1.4.3 (1.5.0 is what I’ll discuss here)."
"That post is quite helpful, but still required digging into the source code to figure out the beast that is coreference resolution."
"Here’s to hoping that I can add a few posts to the conversation and help both myself and, perhaps, others…"
"Most (if not all) of the more advanced OpenNLP components rely on text that is broken into sentences and/or tokens, so I’m starting with those…"
"You’ll need three jar files to get started, all can be found in the binary downloads at http://sourceforge.net/projects/opennlp/files/OpenNLP"
Tools/1.5.0/.
"After expanding the files, you’ll find opennlp-tools.1.5.0.jar and, under the lib folder, maxent-3.0.0.jar and jwnl-1.3.3.jar"
(for the Java WordNet Library).
Update: OpenNLP has since changed their maven repository information.
See the Maven Dependency page for up-to-date information.
You’ll probably want the pre-trained model files as a starting point (rather than creating/training your own).
They can be found at http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/ and are identified by language and component.
For this tutorial you’ll need:
"I use maven, so I just drop these files into src/main/resources and load them with getResourceAsStream, as you’ll see below."
"The Sentence Detector is actually described well on the OpenNLP SourceForge wiki, so I’ll just quote what’s there (errors theirs, emphasis mine):"
The OpenNLP Sentence Detector can detect that a punctuation character marks the end of a sentence or not.
In this sense a sentence is defined as the longest white space trimmed character sequence between two punctuation marks.
The first and last sentence make an exception to this rule.
"The first non whitespace character is assumed to be the begin of a sentence, and the last non whitespace character is assumed to be a sentence end."
The OpenNLP Sentence Detector cannot identify sentence boundaries based on the contents of the sentence.
A prominent example is the first sentence in an article where the title is mistakenly identified to be the first part of the first sentence.
And then actually using the _sentenceDetector is simple:
"Once again, for these simple components the SourceForge documentation has a good description:"
The OpenNLP Tokenizers segment an input character sequence into tokens.
"Tokens are usually words, punctuation, numbers, etc."
"And then, once again, actually using the _tokenizer is simple:"
"Here are the expected results for an example taken from those wiki pages, with an added fourth sentence to show off some edge cases."
"Pierre Vinken, 61 years old, will join the board as a nonexecutive director Nov. 29."
"Mr. Vinken is chairman of Elsevier N.V., the Dutch publishing group."
"Rudolph Agnew, 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, was named a director of this British industrial conglomerate."
Those contraction-less sentences don't have boundary/odd cases...this one does.
